## :pushpin: Project Overview
This project is part of Project Exam 2, designed to showcase the skills developed over the past two years. The goal is to build a modern and fully functional front-end application for Holidaze, a newly launched accommodation booking site.

The application consists of two primary user experiences:

1. Customer-facing – Users can search for venues, view details, and book accommodations.
2. Admin-facing – Venue managers can register, manage venues, and handle bookings.
This project focuses solely on the front-end development, working with the official Holidaze API.
